\section{Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database:} The value database is implemented in C++.
    \AT{Where should we say something about size? If we could find a way to make a smaller but equally useful DB, it might help sell this as something anyone could use.}
    \item \textbf{Fuzzer:} The fuzzer is implemented in R, and is available as an R package.
\end{itemize}
