\section{Threats to Validity}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \ldots our selection of projects may not be representative \ldots
    \item \ldots there's still the oracle problem, i.e., how do we know if a call that reported no errors or warnings was successful? We mitigate this possibility by also comparing the return types of functions \AT{maybe? implement this if it sounds good.} \ldots
    \item \AT{others?}
